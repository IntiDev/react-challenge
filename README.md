### Welcome to the second mini challenge!

with this mini challenge, you will apply some very basics skills about JavaScript and React.
Here, you will find all the instructions needed for this mini challenge.

## Instructions

In this Codesandbox, you have a complete environment with all you need to run your app. You just have to follow the instructions below:

1. Build a new component (class or function it's up to you!) on the file **PokeCard.js**
   you can find it on the **'components/'** folder
   This PokeCard component should be rendered on the **App.js** component (passed as a child)

2. Inside the PokeCard component, show the data from the object **mockPokemonData** in the file **pokedata.js**
   which lives on the **'mock/'** folder **USING JSX**

3. Inside of the **pokeData.js** file, find an object called **mockPokemonData** which contains the
   information related to that pokemon: the **name** of the pokemon and three links to the pokemon's
   images **front_default**, **front_shiny** and **video**
   (all the info is based on the public PokeAPI
   which you can see with more detail here: https://pokeapi.co/)

4. Render on your component the **name** of the pokemon using a _<h1>_ HTML tag

5. Render the images (**front_default** and **front_shiny**) of the pokemon using the _<img src= ...>_
   HTML tag to show them (_sprites_ property from the mock object contains them)

6. Create a link to the Pokemon's video so when you click it, redirects you to the video
   on YouTube using the anchor _<a src=...>_ HTML tag
